// .next/: This is an auto-generated folder by Next.js, where it stores all the build files. You should not touch this folder.

// components/: This is where you put all your React components. It’s common to have a sub-folder structure inside the components folder based on feature or usage.

// pages/: Every file inside the pages folder becomes a route automatically. For example, pages/about.js will be accessible at www.yourwebsite.com/about. The special api folder inside pages is used for API routes.

// public/: The public directory is used by Next.js as the base path when it serves static files (like images).

// styles/: Global styles or CSS modules can be stored here.

// package.json: This file is used by npm to store metadata for projects and manage dependencies.

// next.config.js: A configuration file for Next.js. You can enable extended features here like Sass support, modify webpack and Babel configurations, etc.

// Remember, this is just a suggestion and can be modified based on your project’s needs. The only required file for a Next.js app is the pages directory and a single index.js file inside it.
